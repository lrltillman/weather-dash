# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard allows a user to type the name of any city, and see a five-day forecast for that city with various different points of data being shared. Once a user has searched for a city, that city is saved to local storage and displayed in a drop-down. When a user selects a city from the drop-down and presses "Go", they may see the forecast for that city. 

## Tech Stack

For this project, I used HTML, custom CSS, and JavaScript. I also used OpenWeather API and Geolocation.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
